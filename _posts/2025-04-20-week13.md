# Weekly Blog Post â€“ Week 13

## Work on Group Project

Last Monday, our group, Team Oppia-3, had a productive group work session. We started the class with stand-up reports from each group. Since there are three groups in our class contributing to Oppia, we had a clear understanding of everyone's progress. Our team finalized the first community exploration lesson focusing on Manhattan geography, structured into five chapters, and decided to incorporate voiceover functionality. Over the weekend, we held a Zoom meeting to brainstorm our next community exploration lesson, which will introduce basic Git commands. Given our target audience is relatively young, we aim to present the content in a more accessible and engaging narrative format rather than straightforward explanations.

I also completed 100 translation entries from English to Simplified Chinese and plan to finish around 300 by the time we present. However, I still have concerns that our contributions lack significant coding-related tasks, so I'm hoping to engage more in coding activities this week.

## Open Source in Business/Industry Video

This past week, I watched the "What does Open Core mean?" video. I noted in my comment that the concept of open core stood out to me as an architectural strategy rather than a strict business model. This insight helped me understand that companies can uphold open-source values while still being profitable by leveraging strategies like offering cloud services. The panel discussion was particularly engaging, exploring the delicate balance between openness for community engagement and monetization for business sustainability. It was insightful to hear how companies navigate maintaining trust with the community and meeting investor expectations simultaneously.

## Class Discussion on "Open Source in Film"

During class, we had an intriguing discussion about the "Open Source in Film" video. It was particularly interesting to learn how the film industry is increasingly adopting open-source solutions to address issues like labor shortages and diversity. Studios are realizing the benefits of collaboratively developing foundational tools and frameworks, allowing them to redirect their resources and competitive energy toward creativity and innovation. This collaborative shift not only streamlines production processes but also makes the industry more inclusive by lowering entry barriers for individuals from diverse backgrounds.
