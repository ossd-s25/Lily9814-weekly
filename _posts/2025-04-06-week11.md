## Group Project Progress

Our Oppia-3 team has been making consistent progress over the past weeks. Each member has actively contributed, with myself posting two UI front-end issues and one broken link issue - all of which have been resolved. This quick resolution demonstrates how supportive and active the Oppia community is, confirming it was an excellent open-source project choice for us, especially for a starter like me.

Currently, we're creating our own Oppia community lesson exploration about Manhattan geography. We're planning to develop another lesson, possibly CS-related, and publish both. For the remaining weeks, I hope to complete some coding-related contributions and translate as many messages as possible on the translatewiki website for Oppia from English to Simplified Chinese. There are nearly 2,000 messages awaiting translation. I've contacted the admin, Sean Lip, who mentioned that once the translatewiki translations are complete, I can move on to lesson translation, and he provided contact information for this next step.

## Presentation Reflection

Shivam Balikondwar's presentation was exceptionally informative and helpful. I only recently learned about Google Summer of Code (around the end of February) and had initially planned to apply this year through the Oppia community while taking the Open Source Software Development course. However, I didn't prepare early enough to become familiar with the community and submit enough pull requests, and my proposal lacked professionalism, so I decided not to proceed.

The Linux mentorship program was new to me, and after researching it further, I found it very valuable. Although I started contributing to open source relatively late (in my junior year), I reminded myself that I only switched to a CS major in my sophomore year, and it's never too late to start. Shivam's point about finding interesting open-source projects to make contributions meaningful resonated with me. The presentation was both advising and inspiring!
