# Week 14 Update

## Group Project Progress

This week, our Oppia-3 team made significant progress on several fronts:

1. **Wiki Updates**: We improved our GitHub wiki with comprehensive weekly updates to better document our progress and contributions.

2. **Community Exploration Lessons**: We successfully published two community exploration lessons on the Oppia platform, which marks an important milestone for our project.

3. **Voice-over Feature**: We've decided to enhance our lessons by adding voice-over functionality, which will make our content more accessible and engaging for learners.

4. **Localization Efforts**: I personally completed over 100 translations from English to Simplified Chinese on Oppia's translatewiki platform, contributing to making educational content more accessible to Chinese-speaking users.

5. **Presentation Preparation**: We held a Zoom meeting over the weekend to practice for our upcoming presentation scheduled for this Wednesday.

## Next Steps

For the coming week, our team plans to:

- Deliver our presentation on Wednesday
- Implement the voice-over feature for our published lessons
- Continue with translation efforts
- [Any other planned activities]
