## Group Project Progress

Our Oppia-3 team has been making consistent progress over the past weeks. Each member has actively contributed, with myself posting two UI front-end issues and one broken link issue - all of which have been resolved. This quick resolution demonstrates how supportive and active the Oppia community is, confirming it was an excellent open-source project choice.

Currently, we're creating our own Oppia community lesson exploration about Manhattan geography. We're planning to develop another lesson, possibly CS-related, and publish both. For the remaining weeks, I hope to complete coding-related contributions and translate as many messages as possible on translatewiki from English to Simplified Chinese. There are nearly 2,000 messages awaiting translation. I've contacted the admin, Sean Lip, who mentioned that once the translatewiki translations are complete, I can move on to lesson translation, and he provided contact information for this next step.

## Presentation Reflection

Shivam Balikondwar's presentation was exceptionally informative. I only recently learned about Google Summer of Code and had initially planned to apply this year through the Oppia community while taking the Open Source Software Development course. However, I didn't prepare early enough to become familiar with the community and submit pull requests, and my proposal lacked professionalism, so I decided not to proceed.

The Linux mentorship program was new to me, and after researching it further, I found it very valuable. Although I started contributing to open source relatively late (in my junior year), I reminded myself that I only switched to a CS major in sophomore year. Shivam's point about finding interesting open-source projects to make contributions meaningful resonated with me. The presentation was both helpful and inspiring!
