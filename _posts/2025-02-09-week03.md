title: "Week 3: Team 7 - Browser Scroller"
---

Our team of 3 (team#7) is developing a [Firefox browser extension](https://github.com/ossd-s25/Browser-Scroller.git) for infinite scrolling through auto-reloading content. We quickly aligned on this idea and maximizing our development time.

Communication flows through Discord group chat, with 3~4 voice meetings complementing our asynchronous discussions. The project thus progressed smoothly.

My key contributions include designing the extension's icon logo and creating the style guide. From my perspective, I think overall the collaborative process has been efficient, and it's a good first-time open-source project experience for me. :)
