title: "Week 3: Team 7 - Browser Scroller"
---

Our team of 3 (Team 7) is developing a [Firefox browser extension](https://github.com/ossd-s25/Browser-Scroller.git) for infinite scrolling through auto-reloading content. We quickly aligned on this idea, maximizing our development time.

Communication flows through Discord, with 3 voice meetings complementing our asynchronous discussions. The project has progressed smoothly with minimal issues.

My key contributions include designing the extension's icon logo and creating our style guide. The collaborative process has been efficient, demonstrating our team's strong alignment and clear vision for implementation.
