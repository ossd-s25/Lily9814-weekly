title: "Week 3: Team 7 - Browser Scroller"
---

Our team number is 7, and we aim to create a [Firefox browser extension](https://github.com/ossd-s25/Browser-Scroller.git) that can make the current webpage scroll infinitely by auto-reloading content, so users can endlessly scroll.
We're a group of 3 and we decided on the extension idea very quickly, so there's plenty of time for us to work on it. We use partly asynchronous communication channels Discord for the entire process of the group work. We had 3 synchronous voice meetings and many asynchronous discussions.
