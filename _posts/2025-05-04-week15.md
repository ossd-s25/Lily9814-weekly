# Week 15 Update

## Group Project Presentations

Our Oppia-3 team (Justin, Shay, and I) delivered our presentation on Wednesday this week. As the first group presenting that day, I felt nervous since English is my second language. We met at the Data Science Department an hour before to practice, which helped our presentation go smoothly.

## Learning from Other Teams

Two Oppia teams presented this week, and I learned a lot from all the presenting groups. Each team made diverse contributions to their projects, from coding to content creation. This variety reminded me of the "bazaar" model we learned about in class, where contributors with different skills work in parallel, each adding value in their own way.

## Personal Growth

This project improved my understanding of collaborative development despite initial language anxieties. My translation work (100+ items from English to Simplified Chinese) helped make educational content more accessible to Chinese-speaking users.

## Next Steps

I plan to continue contributing to Oppia, though less frequently than during the course.
